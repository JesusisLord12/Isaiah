  <p>I know it might sound a little crazy that Isaiah is on the list but when you hear what he did in <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/tools/MultiVerse.cfm?s=006HYS"> Isaiah 20: 1,2</a> running around naked and barefoot for three years!</p>
  <p>But God said <a href="https://www.blueletterbible.org/tools/MultiVerse.cfm?s=006HYh">in the next verses:</a> 3 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked and barefoot three years [for] a sign and wonder upon Egypt and upon Ethiopia; 4 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked and barefoot, even with [their] buttocks uncovered, to the shame of Egypt. So it was kinda like a visual aid.</p>
